## Project Pitch

This week, we have been exploring different algorithms and their uses, with the aim of choosing one to focus on for our project. Ultimately we have decided to attempt to improve the prior used by [PBJam](https://github.com/grd349/PBjam). PBJam is a python library used to model the oscillation of stars, in particular, stars which have a convective region just below their surface.

### Bayesian Parameter Estimation
In order to understand the approach taken by PBJam, we should first understand the basics of Bayesian Parameter Estimation, in which we have a model that we want to fit to a set of data by finding suitable values for the parameters in that model.
