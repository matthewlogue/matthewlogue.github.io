Hello, and welcome to my blog about machine learning.

I am a fourth year undergraduate student, studying Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Birmingham.

I have created this blog to help document the progress of my final year project which aims to explore the use of machine learning to model stellar datasets. As this is the first time I have ventured into the realm of machine learning, this will hopefully be a comprehensible introduction to a field that continues to expand to new applications.
